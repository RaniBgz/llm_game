Generate a "kill" objective for a RPG game.
The goal of this objective is for the player to kill a hostile NPC, or a monster.

An objective has several attributes:
- type: The type of the objective ("kill" in this case)
- name: The name of the objective
- description: A brief description of the objective
- target: The target of the objective (e.g., the enemy to kill)

The objective should be generated as a JSON object.

Example 1:
{
  "type": "kill",
  "name": "Kill the dragon",
  "description": "Kill the dragon that is terrorizing the village",
  "target": "dragon"
}

Example 2:
