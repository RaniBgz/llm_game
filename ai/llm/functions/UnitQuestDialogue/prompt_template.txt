Given the following JSON representation of a quest for an RPG game:

{$quest_json}

Generate a QuestDialogue object that contains three Dialogue objects:
1. An initialization dialogue, which introduces the quest and provides initial instructions.
2. A waiting dialogue, which the NPC can use while the player is working on the quest objectives.
3. A completion dialogue, which the NPC can use when the player has completed all the quest objectives.

The dialogue should be engaging, fit the genre and difficulty level of the quest, and provide relevant context and guidance to the player.
Each Dialogue object should be a list of text chunks that the NPC can deliver in sequence.

Output the QuestDialogue object as a JSON string, following the provided format:

{
  "initialization": [
    "First line of the initialization dialogue",
    "Second line of the initialization dialogue",
    ...
  ],
  "waiting": [
    "First line of the waiting dialogue",
    "Second line of the waiting dialogue",
    ...
  ],
  "completion": [
    "First line of the completion dialogue",
    "Second line of the completion dialogue",
    ...
  ]
}

The output should be a JSON ONLY WITH NOTHING ELSE.
